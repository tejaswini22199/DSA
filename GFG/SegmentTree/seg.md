## Segment Tree
* Full binary tree: It has none or 2 children
* Complete Binary tree: It has all levels filled except the last level that's also filled from left.
* Generally Heap uses Complete Binary Tree and Segment Tree uses Full Binary Tree.
* N leaves and N-1 Internal Nodes. So Total 2N-1 nodes.
* Memory : Array with 2*pow(2,logn)-1
